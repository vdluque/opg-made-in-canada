00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,452
Inside the Darlington Energy Complex in Clarington, Ontario

2
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:10,784
is one of the most significant training innovations

3
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:12,065
in the nuclear industry –

4
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:14,077
a state of the art facility

5
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:17,535
that replicates a Darlington reactor vault in full-scale

6
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,622
with every door, pipe,

7
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:22,456
hallway and light fixture the same as the real thing –

8
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:25,479
except here, there’s no radioactivity.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,193
It’s the first full-scale version of its kind in the world

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,921
and it’s getting a lot of use.

11
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:34,368
So far, thousands of workers have experienced

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,073
unprecedented levels of realism in their training –

13
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,615
perfecting procedures and  techniques,

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,975
testing specialised tools

15
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:44,457
and becoming familiar with a nuclear environment.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,231
All before they even set foot in the station.

17
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,347
It’s already making a difference,

18
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:59,010
the Darlington Refurbishment, Canada’s largest clean energy project,

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,699
is proceeding efficiently and safely

20
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:03,532
thanks to the innovation and training

21
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:05,641
developed here in Ontario.
